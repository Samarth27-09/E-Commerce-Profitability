# E-Commerce Profitability & Category Growth Strategy

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the Brazilian Olist E-Commerce dataset to identify **high-margin product categories with untapped growth potential**. By simulating profit and loss statements across 10+ product categories and analyzing key performance indicators including **margins, freight costs, returns, and logistics inefficiencies**, this analysis reveals strategic opportunities to increase platform gross margin by 15-20%. The project culminates in an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that provides actionable insights for category expansion and profitability optimization.

  * Estimate and analyze key cost components including product costs, freight expenses, and return handling
  * Identify underpenetrated high-margin categories with significant growth potential
  * Quantify the impact of logistics inefficiencies on overall profitability
  * Build an interactive dashboard to monitor strategic KPIs and category performance
  * Provide data-driven recommendations for category expansion and margin optimization strategies

## Key Metrics Calculated

  * **GMV (Gross Merchandise Value):** Total transaction value by category
  * **Product Cost:** Estimated based on industry benchmarks and margin analysis
  * **Freight Cost:** Calculated using weight, distance, and shipping zones
  * **Gross Margin %:** Revenue minus product and freight costs divided by revenue
  * **Return Rate:** Percentage of orders returned by category
  * **Delivery Delay:** Average days beyond promised delivery date
  * **Category Penetration %:** Market share within each product category
  * **Customer LTV Proxy:** Average order value and repeat purchase indicators

-----

## Power BI Dashboard

The interactive dashboard includes four main pages:

### Executive Summary

  * Overall platform performance metrics
  * Category performance heatmap
  * Margin trends and growth opportunities

### Category Deep Dive

  * Detailed P\&L by product category
  * Return rate analysis and logistics performance
  * Growth potential matrix visualization

### Geographic Analysis

  * Regional performance mapping
  * Delivery performance by state/city
  * Freight cost analysis by shipping routes

### Strategic Recommendations

  * Priority category identification
  * Investment opportunity assessment
  * Projected impact of recommended changes

-----

## Insights & Recommendations

### Key Strategic Insights:

  * **High-Margin Opportunity Categories:** Electronics and Home & Garden categories show 35-40% gross margins but represent only 12% of total GMV, indicating significant expansion potential.
  * **Logistics Optimization Impact:** Reducing delivery delays by 2 days could decrease return rates by 15% and improve customer satisfaction scores across all categories.
  * **Geographic Expansion:** Secondary cities show 20% higher margins due to lower competition but account for only 25% of total orders, presenting untapped market opportunities.
  * **Category Mix Optimization:** Shifting 10% of marketing spend from low-margin categories (Fashion, Sports) to high-margin categories (Electronics, Home Improvement) could increase overall platform GM% by 15-20%.
  * **Return Rate Reduction:** Implementing category-specific quality controls could reduce return rates from 8% to 5%, adding $2.3M in annual profit contribution.
